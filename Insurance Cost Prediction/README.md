## Insurance Cost Prediction

*This Project was the part of course [Deep Learning with Pytorch: Zero to GANS](https://jovian.ai/learn/deep-learning-with-pytorch-zero-to-gans) by [jovian.ai](https://jovian.ai) in collabration with freecodecamp.*

### Overview

In this Project I've used information like a person's age, sex, BMI, no. of children and smoking habit to predict the price of yearly medical bills using `linear regression model`. This kind of model is useful for insurance companies to determine the yearly insurance premium for a person.

**The Project consist of following steps :**

- Load an explore the dataset.
- Prepare the dataset for training
- Create a Linear regression model
- Train the model to fit the data
- Make predictions using the trained model

### How to Run the code

This code can be run in couple of ways : *using free online resources or on your computer locally*.

#####  Option 1: Running using free online resources 

Use *Google Colab*. [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) is a free online platform for running Jupyter notebooks using Google's cloud infrastructure. You can also use [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com).

##### Option 2: Running on your computer locally

To run the code on your computer locally, you'll need to set up [Python](https://www.python.org/), download the notebook and install the required libraries. I recommend using the [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/) distribution of Python. 

**Jupyter Notebooks:**[Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) - a document made of cells. Each cell can contain code written in Python or explanations in plain English. You can execute code cells and view the results, e.g., numbers, messages, graphs, tables, files, etc. instantly within the notebook. Jupyter is a powerful platform for experimentation and analysis. mess around with the code & break things - you'll learn a lot by encountering and fixing errors. You can use the "Kernel > Restart & Clear Output" or "Edit > Clear Outputs" menu option to clear all outputs and start again from the top.
