## Customer Churn Prediction

### Overview

In this Project I have Created different ML models(`logistic regression`,`Decision tree classifier`,`random forest`and `SVM`) to predict customer churn at a fictitious wireless telecom company and use insights from the model to develop an different strategy for Customer retention and growth. Such insights can effectively help buisnesses to know more about their customer behaviour so that they can segment those customers that are highly likely to churn and provide better services to them. In this way, they can achieve a high customer retention rate and maximize their revenue.
Also I have looked at data from customers that already have churned (response) and their characteristics / behaviour (predictors) before the churn happened. By fitting a statistical model that relates the predictors to the response, I have tried to predict the response for existing customers.

### Strcuture of Project : 

**This Project is divided in 5 setps:**
- Understanding the Problem Statement
- Loading and understanding the data 
- EDA and Data Pre-processing
- Modelling 
- Model evaluation and generate insights

### How to Run the code

This code can be run in couple of ways : *using free online resources or on your computer locally*.

#####  Option 1: Running using free online resources 

Use *Google Colab*. [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) is a free online platform for running Jupyter notebooks using Google's cloud infrastructure. You can also use [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com).

##### Option 2: Running on your computer locally

To run the code on your computer locally, you'll need to set up [Python](https://www.python.org/), download the notebook and install the required libraries. I recommend using the [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/) distribution of Python. 

**Jupyter Notebooks:** I had Run my code locally in [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) - a document made of cells. Each cell can contain code written in Python or explanations in plain English. You can execute code cells and view the results, e.g., numbers, messages, graphs, tables, files, etc. instantly within the notebook. Jupyter is a powerful platform for experimentation and analysis. mess around with the code & break things - you'll learn a lot by encountering and fixing errors. You can use the "Kernel > Restart & Clear Output" or "Edit > Clear Outputs" menu option to clear all outputs and start again from the top.

### Libraries used 

- **scikit-learn** - [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) is the most useful and robust library for machine learning in Python. It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python.

- **Pandas** - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is a Software library written for data manipulation and analysis in Python. Offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.

- **Numpy** - [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

- **Matplotlib** - [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) Python 2D plotting Data visualization library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. 

- **Seaborn** - [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) Seaborn is a Python visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics and closely integrated with pandas data structures.
