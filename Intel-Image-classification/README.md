## Intel Image Classification 

*This was the capstone Project of Course [Deep Learning with PyTorch: Zero to GANS](https://jovian.ai/learn/deep-learning-with-pytorch-zero-to-gans) by [jovian.ai](https://jovian.ai) in collabration with freecodecamp.*

### Overview

In this Project I've used Intel Image dataset for classification problem. The task was to classify the given images and train a model to predict any previously unseen images which belongs to one of the classes with maximum accuracy using deep neural network, CNN and ResNets architecture (In this used ResNet9).

**The Project consist of following steps :**

- Load and explore dataset 
- Prepare the dataset for taining
- Define a model and pick some hyperparameters
- Train the model
- Make predictions on samples using the trained model

### How to Run the code

This code can be run in couple of ways : *using free online resources or on your computer locally*.

#####  Option 1: Running using free online resources 

Use *Google Colab*. [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) is a free online platform for running Jupyter notebooks using Google's cloud infrastructure. You can also use [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com).

##### Option 2: Running on your computer locally

To run the code on your computer locally, you'll need to set up [Python](https://www.python.org/), download the notebook and install the required libraries. I recommend using the [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/) distribution of Python. 

**Jupyter Notebooks:**[Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) - a document made of cells. Each cell can contain code written in Python or explanations in plain English. You can execute code cells and view the results, e.g., numbers, messages, graphs, tables, files, etc. instantly within the notebook. Jupyter is a powerful platform for experimentation and analysis. mess around with the code & break things - you'll learn a lot by encountering and fixing errors. You can use the "Kernel > Restart & Clear Output" or "Edit > Clear Outputs" menu option to clear all outputs and start again from the top.

### Libraries used 


- **Pandas** - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is a Software library written for data manipulation and analysis in Python. Offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.

- **Numpy** - [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

- **Matplotlib** - [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) Python 2D plotting Data visualization library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. 

- **Pytorch** - [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) is an open source machine learning library based on the Torch library that facilitates building deep learning projects with strong GPU acceleration.
