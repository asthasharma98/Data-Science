## Netflix Data Analysis on TV Shows and Movies

*This is the Capstone Project of course [Data Analysis with Python: Zero to Pandas](https://jovian.ai/learn/data-analysis-with-python-zero-to-pandas) by [jovian.ai](https://jovian.ai) in collabration with freecodecamp.*
*I am greatful to be a part of this course as it is well-structured with such a stimulating community.*

**About Project :**

In this Project I have performed a exploratory Data analysis to find some hidden trends and pattern in dataset. I have loaded and read the data using pandas, did some cleaning and Processing of data and explored the dataset through visualizations and graphs using matplotlib and seaborn and finally answerd some questions related to datase such as most `popular genre on netflix`, `ratings of netflix content`, `top TV  shows and movies etc`.

### How to Run the code

This code can be run in couple of ways : *using free online resources or on your computer locally*.

#####  Option 1: Running using free online resources 

Use *Google Colab*. [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) is a free online platform for running Jupyter notebooks using Google's cloud infrastructure. You can also use [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com).

##### Option 2: Running on your computer locally

To run the code on your computer locally, you'll need to set up [Python](https://www.python.org/), download the notebook and install the required libraries. I recommend using the [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/) distribution of Python. 

**Jupyter Notebooks:** [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) - a document made of cells. Each cell can contain code written in Python or explanations in plain English. You can execute code cells and view the results, e.g., numbers, messages, graphs, tables, files, etc. instantly within the notebook. Jupyter is a powerful platform for experimentation and analysis. mess around with the code & break things - you'll learn a lot by encountering and fixing errors. You can use the "Kernel > Restart & Clear Output" or "Edit > Clear Outputs" menu option to clear all outputs and start again from the top.
I had run my code on google colab and hosted on jovian.

### Libraries used 

- **Pandas** - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is a Software library written for data manipulation and analysis in Python. Offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.

- **Numpy** - [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

- **Matplotlib** - [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) Python 2D plotting Data visualization library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. 

- **Seaborn** - [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) Seaborn is a Python visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics and closely integrated with pandas data structures.
