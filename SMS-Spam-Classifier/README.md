### Overview:

- Created a machine learning model that detects/classifies a SMS into SPAM or HAM (normal) based on the textual data using Natural Language Processing.
- Engineered features like word_count, contains_currency_symbol, and contains_number from the text SMS.

### How this project is useful?

- This project helps in filtering/cleaning the SMS from the phone.

### Resources Used : 

- Packages: pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, nltk.
- Dataset by UCI Machine Learing on Kaggle: [https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset)
